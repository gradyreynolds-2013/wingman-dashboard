## 2. Subject-To (Subto) Deals

### What is a Subject-To Deal?

A **Subject-To** deal is when you purchase a property "subject to" the existing mortgage remaining in place. The seller deeds you the property, but their loan stays in their name. You take over making the mortgage payments, but the bank doesn't know the property has changed hands.

**Example:**
- Seller owes $200K on a $300K house
- You buy it "subject to" the existing $200K loan
- Deed transfers to you
- Loan stays in seller's name
- You make the $200K in payments
- You get $100K in equity instantly (if appraisal holds)

### Why Sellers Agree to This

Sellers who accept Subject-To deals are typically in distress:
- Behind on payments (foreclosure avoidance)
- Need to relocate quickly (job transfer, divorce)
- Inherited property they don't want
- Negative equity or break-even situation
- Can't afford repairs to sell traditionally

**The seller gets:**
- Out from under a payment they can't make
- Foreclosure avoided (saves their credit)
- Relief from a burden property
- Sometimes cash for moving expenses

### Pros of Subject-To

**For the Buyer:**
- No bank qualification needed
- Little to no money down
- Instant equity if bought below market value
- Existing interest rate (can be great if locked in low)
- Fast closing (no loan approval process)
- Control of property immediately

**For the Seller:**
- Avoids foreclosure
- Gets out from under payments
- Credit damage minimized
- Fast solution to a problem property

### Cons and Risks

**Due-on-Sale Clause:**
- Every mortgage has a "due-on-sale" clause
- Technically allows the bank to call the loan due if ownership transfers
- **Reality:** Banks rarely enforce this if payments are being made
- Risk increases if payments are missed or property isn't insured properly

**Seller's Credit at Risk:**
- Loan stays in seller's name
- If you stop paying, seller's credit gets destroyed
- Ethical obligation to protect the seller's credit

**Insurance Complications:**
- Property must be insured
- Insurance must cover your interest as the owner and the lender's interest
- Seller's name may need to stay on insurance initially

**Title Issues:**
- Clear title required
- Must ensure no hidden liens
- Title company may refuse to insure Subject-To deals (not all do)

### Legal Considerations

- **Fully legal** in all 50 states when done correctly
- Requires proper documentation:
  - Deed transfer (recorded)
  - Subject-To agreement (lays out terms)
  - Authorization to release loan information
  - Power of Attorney (optional, for managing loan)
- Attorney review recommended in every state
- Full disclosure to seller required (ethical and legal)

## 3. Creative Finance Strategies (Beyond Subject-To)

Pace Morby teaches a full toolkit of creative finance methods:

### Seller Financing (Owner Carry)
- Seller acts as the bank
- Buyer makes payments directly to seller
- Seller holds the note, buyer gets deed (or deed held in escrow until paid off)
- Great for free-and-clear properties or sellers who want income

**Example Structure:**
- $300K house, seller owns free and clear
- Buyer: 10% down ($30K)
- Seller carries $270K at 6% interest over 20 years
- Buyer gets deed, seller gets monthly income

### Wrap-Around Mortgage (AITD - All-Inclusive Trust Deed)
- Seller has existing financing
- Buyer creates NEW note that "wraps" the old one
- Buyer pays seller, seller pays original lender
- Seller profits from interest rate spread

**Example:**
- Seller owes $200K at 4%
- You create $250K wrap at 7%
- You pay seller $250K payment
- Seller pays bank $200K payment
- Seller profits from $50K equity + 3% spread

### Lease Option (Rent-to-Own)
- Buyer leases property with option to purchase later
- Portion of rent credits toward purchase
- Locks in purchase price today
- Gives time to improve credit, raise capital, or flip

**Example:**
- Lease for 2 years at $2K/month
- $500/month credits toward purchase
- Purchase price locked at $300K
- After 2 years: $12K in credits, can buy or walk away

### Novation
- Buyer takes over seller's contract with a third party
- Often used when seller has property under contract but can't close
- You step into their shoes, close the deal, profit from the spread

## 5. Pace's Teaching Philosophy & Mindset

### Core Principles

**1. Action Over Perfection**
- "Take action immediately and stick with it until you see success"
- Don't wait for perfect knowledge - learn by doing
- Pace may even partner with members on their deals

**2. Creative Problem Solving**
- Every distressed seller has a unique problem
- Creative finance is about solving THEIR problem, not just buying cheap
- Structure the deal around what works for them

**3. No Banks Required**
- Traditional financing is a bottleneck
- Creative finance removes the bank from the equation
- Faster closings, more deals, less red tape

**4. Ethical Wealth Building**
- Protect the seller - don't screw people in distress
- Win-win structures
- Long-term reputation matters more than one deal

**5. Think Bigger**
- Pace encourages scaling beyond single-family homes
- Multifamily, commercial, large portfolios
- Build systems, not just do deals

### The "Pace Morby Way"

Endorsed by Codie Sanchez:
*"I see a guy who bought a whole universe of schulitz who told him you can't do it that way and he said 'f*** it, watch me!'"*

**Translation:** Pace challenges conventional wisdom. If everyone says "you need 20% down and a bank loan," he shows you 10 other ways to close the deal.

## 6. Opportunity Zones + Creative Finance

### What are Opportunity Zones?

- Created by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
- Economically distressed areas designated for investment incentives
- **Tax Benefits:**
  - Defer capital gains taxes by investing in Opportunity Zone properties
  - Reduce capital gains by 10% if held 5+ years
  - **Eliminate capital gains entirely** on new appreciation if held 10+ years

### How Pace's Methods Apply to Opportunity Zones

**Perfect Synergy:**
1. **Low Entry Cost:** Creative finance = little capital required upfront
2. **High Upside:** Opportunity Zones = depressed areas ripe for appreciation
3. **Tax Shelter:** Hold properties long-term, avoid capital gains on appreciation
4. **Cash Flow + Appreciation:** Rehab apartments in Opportunity Zones, rent them out, benefit from both monthly income and long-term tax-free gains

**Strategy for Grady:**
- Acquire distressed apartment buildings in Opportunity Zones using Subject-To or seller financing
- Rehab and stabilize (increase rents, reduce vacancies)
- Hold 10+ years to eliminate capital gains tax on the upside
- Build vertically integrated company: acquisition, construction, property management

**Example Deal Structure:**
- Find a distressed 10-unit apartment building in an Opportunity Zone
- Current owner behind on payments, building needs work
- Acquire Subject-To: take over existing $400K mortgage
- Invest $100K in rehab (could be separate OZ fund)
- Increase rents from $800/unit to $1,200/unit (post-rehab)
- Cash flow: $4K/month after expenses
- Hold 10+ years: sell for $1.2M, pay ZERO capital gains on the $800K gain

## 7. Common Pitfalls & Due Diligence

### What Trips Up Beginners

**1. Skipping Due Diligence**
- Not pulling title (hidden liens destroy deals)
- Not verifying mortgage balance/payment amount
- Not confirming seller actually owns the property

**2. Poor Seller Communication**
- Failing to fully explain the deal to the seller
- Not protecting seller's interests
- Leaving sellers confused or feeling scammed

**3. Ignoring the Due-on-Sale Clause**
- Thinking it's "illegal" and avoiding Subject-To entirely
- OR thinking it's no big deal and getting sloppy
- **Reality:** Respect the risk, but don't let it paralyze you

**4. No Exit Strategy**
- Buying properties you can't cash flow or sell
- No plan for what happens if deal goes south
- Creative finance without backend planning = disaster

**5. Bad Math**
- Underestimating rehab costs
- Overestimating rents
- Ignoring hidden expenses (taxes, insurance, HOA, etc.)

### Due Diligence Checklist

**Before Every Subject-To Deal:**
- [ ] Pull title report (clear title?)
- [ ] Verify mortgage balance and payment (call lender with seller authorization)
- [ ] Check payment history (is seller actually current?)
- [ ] Inspect property (what's the real rehab cost?)
- [ ] Verify insurance can be obtained in your name
- [ ] Check for HOA liens, tax liens, mechanic's liens
- [ ] Run comps (is the deal actually good?)
- [ ] Meet the seller face-to-face (gut check: are they legitimate?)
- [ ] Have attorney review documents (varies by state)

**For Apartment Buildings in Opportunity Zones:**
- [ ] Verify property is in a designated Opportunity Zone (IRS map)
- [ ] Analyze current rent roll and expenses (real numbers, not pro forma)
- [ ] Inspect all units (vacancy, deferred maintenance)
- [ ] Check local rental market (what's realistic post-rehab rent?)
- [ ] Confirm zoning allows your intended use
- [ ] Assess neighborhood trajectory (is the area improving?)
