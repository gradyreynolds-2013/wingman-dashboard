## 2. Subject-To (Subto) Deals

### What is a Subject-To Deal?

A **Subject-To (Subto)** deal is a real estate acquisition strategy where the buyer purchases a property "subject to" the existing mortgage. The deed transfers to the buyer, but the original mortgage remains in the seller's name, and the buyer takes over making the monthly payments.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Deed transfers** to the buyer
- **Mortgage stays** in the seller's name
- **Buyer assumes** responsibility for payments
- **No new loan** is originated
- **No bank qualification** required

### How Subject-To Deals Work

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Identify Motivated Seller**
   - Facing foreclosure
   - Job relocation
   - Inherited property they don't want
   - Behind on payments
   - Divorce or financial hardship

2. **Analyze the Deal**
   - Current mortgage balance
   - Interest rate on existing loan
   - Monthly payment amount
   - Property value vs. loan balance
   - Equity position

3. **Negotiate Terms**
   - Purchase price (often equal to mortgage balance)
   - Any cash to seller at closing
   - Timeline for closing
   - Who handles back payments (if any)

4. **Legal Structure**
   - Title transfers via deed
   - Authorization to Make Payment (AMP) agreement
   - Deed is recorded
   - Mortgage remains in seller's name
   - Insurance is updated

5. **Ongoing Management**
   - Buyer makes monthly mortgage payments
   - Property is rented or held for appreciation
   - Cash flow covers payments plus generates profit
   - Exit strategy planned from day one

### Pros of Subject-To Deals

**For Buyers:**
- **No bank qualification** - Credit score doesn't matter
- **Little to no money down** - Can acquire property with minimal capital
- **Faster closing** - No lengthy loan approval process
- **Keep existing low interest rates** - Especially valuable in high-rate environments
- **Build portfolio quickly** - Can do multiple deals simultaneously
- **Creative solutions** - More flexibility than traditional financing
- **Cash flow immediately** - Can rent property right away

**For Sellers:**
- **Avoid foreclosure** - Get out from under mortgage
- **No realtor fees** - Saves 5-6% commission
- **Quick sale** - Can close in days, not months
- **Credit protection** - Payments continue, protecting credit score
- **Relief from burden** - No more mortgage stress
- **Possible cash at closing** - Depending on deal structure

### Cons and Risks

**For Buyers:**
- **Due-on-Sale Clause Risk** - Lender can technically call the loan due when title transfers
- **Seller default risk** - If seller doesn't maintain their credit, it could affect you
- **Mortgage in seller's name** - Can't refinance without paying off loan
- **Title issues** - Must ensure clear title
- **Insurance complications** - Need proper coverage structure
- **Seller cooperation needed** - For any mortgage-related issues
- **Exit strategy limitations** - Can't do traditional cash-out refinance easily

**For Sellers:**
- **Mortgage stays on credit** - Affects debt-to-income ratio for future purchases
- **Trust required** - Must trust buyer to make payments
- **Lender contact** - May still receive mortgage statements
- **Tax implications** - May have tax consequences from sale
- **Liability concerns** - Name still on mortgage if buyer defaults

### Legal Considerations

**Critical Legal Elements:**

1. **Due-on-Sale Clause (Alienation Clause)**
   - Found in most mortgages
   - Gives lender right to call loan due upon title transfer
   - **Reality:** Rarely enforced if payments continue
   - Banks prefer receiving payments over foreclosing
   - More common in commercial loans than residential

2. **Proper Documentation**
   - **Warranty Deed or Quit Claim Deed** - Transfers title
   - **Authorization to Make Payment (AMP)** - Allows buyer to make payments
   - **Land Trust** - Optional structure for additional protection
   - **Purchase Agreement** - Outlines all terms
   - **Disclosure statements** - Full transparency required

3. **Insurance Requirements**
   - **Hazard Insurance** - Must be in place
   - **Title Insurance** - Protects against title defects
   - **Liability Insurance** - Protects the buyer
   - **Proper insured parties** - Complex structuring needed

4. **State-Specific Regulations**
   - Some states have stricter enforcement
   - Attorney consultation recommended
   - Varies by jurisdiction
   - Dodd-Frank Act considerations for owner-occupied properties

5. **Dodd-Frank Compliance**
   - Applies to owner-occupied properties with mortgages originated after 2014
   - Requires balloon payments be at least 5 years out
   - Seller must have owned property for certain period
   - Limits on number of seller-financed deals per year

### When to Use Subject-To

**Best Scenarios:**
- Seller is in pre-foreclosure
- Property has low interest rate mortgage
- Seller has little to no equity
- Quick closing needed
- Buyer has limited capital or credit issues
- Market is experiencing high interest rates
- Property has good rental potential

**Avoid When:**
- Seller has significant equity (other strategies better)
- Mortgage interest rate is very high
- Seller is uncooperative or suspicious
- Title has liens or clouds
- Property needs extensive repairs beyond budget
- Deal numbers don't support cash flow

## 3. Creative Finance Strategies

Beyond Subject-To, Pace Morby teaches a comprehensive toolkit of creative financing strategies. Understanding all of these allows you to structure the right deal for each situation.

### Seller Financing (Owner Financing)

**What It Is:**
The property seller acts as the bank, allowing the buyer to make payments directly to them over time instead of obtaining a traditional mortgage.

**How It Works:**
1. Buyer and seller agree on purchase price
2. Terms are negotiated (interest rate, down payment, length of loan)
3. Promissory note is created outlining payment terms
4. Deed may transfer immediately (with mortgage secured by property) or at end of payment period
5. Buyer makes monthly payments to seller
6. Once paid off, deed transfers (if not already transferred)

**Key Elements:**
- **Down payment:** Typically 10-30% (negotiable)
- **Interest rate:** Usually higher than bank rates (6-10%+ currently)
- **Term:** Often 3-5 years with balloon payment
- **Payment structure:** Typically amortized over 20-30 years with early balloon
- **Security:** Deed of Trust or Mortgage on property

**Advantages:**
- **For Buyer:** No bank qualification, faster closing, flexible terms, build equity
- **For Seller:** Higher sale price, monthly income stream, tax advantages (spread capital gains), higher interest than savings accounts

**When to Use:**
- Buyer cannot qualify for traditional financing
- Seller owns property free and clear
- Seller wants income stream rather than lump sum
- Quick closing needed
- Property difficult to finance traditionally (unique property, rural, etc.)

### Wrap-Around Mortgage (All-Inclusive Trust Deed - AITD)

**What It Is:**
A form of seller financing where the seller has an existing mortgage, and the buyer makes payments to the seller, who continues making payments on the original mortgage. The buyer's loan "wraps around" the existing mortgage.

**How It Works:**
1. Seller has existing mortgage of $200,000 at 4% interest
2. Property worth $300,000
3. Buyer puts down $30,000
4. Seller creates wrap mortgage for $270,000 at 7% interest
5. Buyer makes payments to seller on $270,000
6. Seller continues making payments on original $200,000 loan
7. Seller keeps the spread ($70,000 additional principal + interest differential)

**Key Features:**
- Title usually transfers to buyer
- Seller maintains original mortgage
- Buyer makes one payment to seller
- Seller profits from interest rate differential
- Buyer's payment covers seller's underlying mortgage payment

**Advantages:**
- Seller earns interest spread
- Buyer avoids new loan costs
- Faster closing than traditional sale
- Seller can sell property with existing favorable loan
- Buyer may get better rate than current market

**Risks:**
- Due-on-sale clause risk on underlying mortgage
- Seller must be trustworthy (continues making underlying payments)
- Complex legal documentation needed
- Default on either loan affects the structure

**When to Use:**
- Seller has low-interest existing mortgage
- Significant equity in property
- Buyer can't get traditional financing
- Current market rates are high
- Seller wants ongoing income

### Lease Option (Lease with Option to Purchase)

**What It Is:**
A rental agreement that gives the tenant the **option** (but not obligation) to purchase the property at a predetermined price during or at the end of the lease term.

**How It Works:**
1. **Option Fee:** Tenant pays upfront option consideration (1-5% of purchase price) - usually non-refundable
2. **Lease Term:** Typically 1-3 years
3. **Rent Credits:** Portion of monthly rent (often $100-500/month) credited toward purchase price
4. **Exercise Period:** Tenant has defined window to exercise option
5. **Purchase:** If tenant exercises option, credits apply to purchase price
6. **Expiration:** If not exercised, seller keeps option fee and rent credits

**Key Terms:**
- **Option Consideration:** $5,000-$25,000 depending on property value
- **Purchase Price:** Set at beginning (locks in today's price)
- **Rent Premium:** $100-$500 above market rent goes toward purchase
- **Term Length:** 1-3 years typically
- **Maintenance:** Usually tenant-buyer responsible for repairs

**Advantages:**
- **For Buyer:** Time to improve credit, lock in price, test property/neighborhood, build down payment through rent credits
- **For Seller:** Premium rent, option fee income, property maintained by tenant-buyer, potential full sale at end

**When to Use:**
- Buyer needs time to improve credit
- Buyer wants to test neighborhood
- Seller struggling to sell in slow market
- Property needs minor repairs buyer can complete
- Buyer not quite ready financially but will be soon

### Lease Purchase (Lease-to-Own)

**What It Is:**
Similar to lease option, but tenant is **obligated** to purchase at the end of the lease term. This is a binding purchase contract with delayed closing.

**Key Differences from Lease Option:**
- **Obligation vs. Option:** Tenant MUST buy (not optional)
- **Stronger commitment:** Both parties locked in
- **Financing risk:** Buyer must be confident they'll qualify
- **Default consequences:** Buyer loses everything if can't perform

**When to Use:**
- Buyer is confident about future financing
- Both parties want certainty of sale
- Buyer wants strongest possible position
- Credit improvement plan is clear and achievable

### Novation

**What It Is:**
The process of substituting one party to a contract with another party. In real estate, typically means getting the lender to agree to substitute the buyer for the seller on the existing mortgage.

**How It Works:**
1. Buyer and seller agree to transfer property
2. Buyer approaches original lender
3. Lender agrees to substitute buyer for seller on existing loan
4. New loan documents are created
5. Seller is released from mortgage obligation
6. Buyer assumes loan with lender's approval

**Advantages:**
- **For Seller:** Complete release from mortgage obligation
- **For Buyer:** Assume existing loan terms (potentially favorable rate)
- **Lower risk:** No due-on-sale clause concerns
- **Clean transfer:** Lender-approved substitution

**Challenges:**
- **Difficult to achieve:** Banks rarely agree
- **Qualification required:** Buyer must qualify with lender
- **Time-consuming:** Bank approval process
- **Not common:** Hard to find lenders willing to do this

**When to Pursue:**
- Existing mortgage has very favorable terms
- Buyer has good credit and income
- Seller wants complete release from obligation
- Time is not critical concern
- Relationship with lender exists

### Master Lease with Option to Purchase

**What It Is:**
Leasing an entire property (or portfolio) with the option to purchase, typically used for commercial or multi-family properties. Tenant controls and operates the property while having option to buy.

**How It Works:**
1. Investor leases entire apartment building (for example)
2. Investor subleases units to tenants
3. Investor keeps cash flow spread
4. Option to purchase at predetermined price
5. Rent credits may apply to purchase price

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-family properties
- Commercial properties
- Apartment buildings
- Property portfolios
- Buildings needing repositioning

**Advantages:**
- Control property without ownership capital
- Test property management and operations
- Build up down payment through cash flow
- Option to buy after improving operations/value
- Lock in purchase price while property appreciates

### Equity Partnerships

**What It Is:**
Partnering with capital providers or other investors to split ownership and responsibilities.

**Common Structures:**
- **Money Partner + Operator:** Capital partner provides funds, operator manages deal (often 50/50 split)
- **JV (Joint Venture):** Two or more parties co-invest with defined roles
- **Syndication:** Pooling money from multiple investors for larger deals
- **Equity Participation:** Seller retains percentage of equity/future profits

**When to Use:**
- Lack sufficient capital for deal
- Need specific expertise (construction, management, etc.)
- Larger deal than you can handle alone
- Spread risk across multiple investors
- Access to better deals through partner relationships

### Assumed Mortgages (FHA/VA Assumable Loans)

**What It Is:**
Formally taking over an existing mortgage with the lender's approval. FHA and VA loans are typically assumable.

**How It Works:**
1. Verify loan is assumable (FHA/VA typically are)
2. Buyer applies with lender to assume
3. Lender qualifies buyer
4. Buyer pays seller any equity (price minus loan balance)
5. Lender releases seller, substitutes buyer
6. Loan terms remain the same

**Advantages:**
- Keep favorable interest rates
- Lower closing costs than new mortgage
- Formal lender approval (no due-on-sale risk)
- Seller fully released from obligation

**When to Target:**
- Property has FHA or VA loan
- Existing rate much lower than current market
- Buyer can qualify with lender
- Equity amount is manageable

### Contract for Deed (Land Contract)

**What It Is:**
Seller retains legal title while buyer makes payments. Deed transfers only after all payments made.

**How It Works:**
1. Buyer and seller agree on price and terms
2. Buyer makes down payment
3. Buyer makes monthly payments to seller
4. **Seller retains deed** until paid off
5. Buyer has equitable interest (can occupy and improve)
6. After final payment, deed transfers

**Risks:**
- **For Buyer:** Don't have deed/legal title until paid off; seller could encumber property
- **For Seller:** Buyer may trash property; foreclosure needed if buyer defaults (not simple eviction)

**When Used:**
- Buyer has very poor credit
- Property difficult to finance
- Rural or unique properties
- Seller wants maximum security
- Short term (3-5 year balloon) expected

### Private Money Lending

**What It Is:**
Borrowing from private individuals or companies rather than banks.

**Sources:**
- Friends and family
- Other investors
- Private lending companies
- Self-directed IRA investors
- Hard money lenders

**Typical Terms:**
- **Interest Rates:** 8-15%
- **Points:** 2-5 points upfront
- **Terms:** 6 months to 3 years
- **LTV (Loan-to-Value):** 65-75% typically

**When to Use:**
- Need fast funding
- Property doesn't qualify for bank loan
- Credit issues prevent bank financing
- Short-term bridge financing needed
- Fix-and-flip projects
- Deal too good to wait for bank approval

## 5. Pace's Teaching Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Take Immediate Action**

Pace's #1 principle: **Stop learning, start doing.**

**Key Beliefs:**
- Analysis paralysis kills more deals than mistakes
- Perfect is the enemy of done
- Learn by doing, not just studying
- Your first deal won't be perfect—do it anyway
- Momentum comes from action, not preparation

**How He Teaches This:**
- Pushes members to make offers within first week
- "Imperfect action beats perfect inaction"
- Celebrates action, even when deals fall through
- Shares his early mistakes to encourage risk-taking

#### 2. **Solve Problems, Don't Just Buy Houses**

**Philosophy:**
Real estate is about solving sellers' problems, not just acquiring properties.

**Approach:**
- Listen to seller's actual needs
- What problem are they trying to solve?
- How can you provide a solution?
- Win-win or no deal
- Long-term relationships over one-time transactions

**Example Problems Pace Solves:**
- Avoiding foreclosure
- Relocating for job quickly
- Inherited property they don't want
- Divorce situation needing quick resolution
- Property in disrepair they can't afford to fix
- Behind on payments and drowning

**The Mindset Shift:**
- From: "How can I get this property cheap?"
- To: "How can I solve this person's problem while also making money?"

#### 3. **Creative Finance is About Freedom**

**Core Belief:**
Banks control traditional real estate investing. Creative finance provides freedom.

**Freedom Principles:**
- **Freedom from Credit Scores:** Your credit doesn't determine your ability to build wealth
- **Freedom from Capital:** Don't need $100k saved to start
- **Freedom from Bank Approval:** Don't wait months for loan approval
- **Freedom from Traditional Rules:** Create your own investment criteria
- **Freedom to Scale:** Do multiple deals simultaneously

**Impact:**
Opens real estate investing to people who traditional finance excludes:
- Young people without established credit
- Those recovering from bankruptcy or foreclosure
- People with good income but poor credit history
- Entrepreneurs with inconsistent income documentation
- Anyone who refuses to let banks dictate their timeline

#### 4. **Community Over Competition**

**Philosophy:**
There are enough deals for everyone. Collaboration multiplies success.

**How This Shows Up:**
- Open sharing of strategies and templates
- Members helping members with deals
- Partnership opportunities
- Referrals when deal doesn't fit your criteria
- Celebrating others' success
- Teaching builds your own expertise

**Contrast to Traditional Real Estate:**
- Traditional: Hoard information, protect secrets
- Pace's Way: Share everything, rising tide lifts all boats

#### 5. **Stick With It Until Success**

**Belief:**
Most people quit right before breakthrough. Persistence separates successful investors from everyone else.

**How He Instills This:**
- Shares his own failures and perseverance
- Highlights member breakthrough stories
- Provides support through difficult times
- Accountability through community
- "Your breakthrough is in your next offer"

**Typical Timeline Reality:**
- Months 1-3: Learning and frustration
- Months 3-6: First deal (often hardest)
- Months 6-12: Momentum builds
- Year 2+: Systems working, scaling begins

**Pace's Encouragement:**
- Most quit after 3-6 months
- Those who persist past the "messy middle" win
- Every no gets you closer to yes
- Skill compounds with each deal attempted

#### 6. **Think Bigger, Reach Higher**

**Philosophy:**
Most people set goals too small. Dream bigger, then figure out how.

**Application:**
- Don't just aim for one rental property
- Build a portfolio
- Think multi-family, not just single-family
- Scale systemically
- Create passive income, not just a side hustle

**Mindset Questions Pace Asks:**
- "What would you do if you couldn't fail?"
- "How many units could you really handle?"
- "What's the deal size that scares you? Now double it."
- "Are you thinking like a dabbler or an empire builder?"

### Pace's Decision-Making Framework

**When Evaluating a Deal:**

✅ **DO THE DEAL IF:**
- Numbers work (cash flow positive or clear path)
- Solving real problem for seller
- Legal structure sound
- Risk mitigated
- Clear exit strategy
- Your gut says yes

❌ **WALK AWAY IF:**
- Numbers don't work (don't force it)
- Seller unrealistic or difficult
- Legal/title issues you can't resolve
- Risk too high for experience level
- Your gut says no (trust intuition)

**Pace's Gut Check:**
"If I'm trying to talk myself into a deal, it's probably not the right deal. When it's right, you know."

### Mindset Pace Instills

**From Scarcity to Abundance:**
- **Scarcity:** "This is my only chance, I must make it work"
- **Abundance:** "There are infinite deals; I'll do the right ones"

**From Perfectionism to Progress:**
- **Perfectionism:** "I need to know everything before I start"
- **Progress:** "I'll learn what I need as I go"

**From Fear to Faith:**
- **Fear:** "What if I fail and lose everything?"
- **Faith:** "What if I succeed and change my life?"

**From Employee to Entrepreneur:**
- **Employee:** "I need permission and guarantees"
- **Entrepreneur:** "I'll figure it out and take calculated risks"

## 6. Opportunity Zones + Creative Finance

### Understanding Opportunity Zones

**What Are Opportunity Zones?**

Opportunity Zones are **economically distressed communities** where new investments may be eligible for preferential tax treatment under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

**Key Features:**
- Designated by state governors and certified by U.S. Treasury
- Typically economically disadvantaged areas
- Designed to spur economic development and job creation
- Found in all 50 states, District of Columbia, and U.S. territories
- Over 8,700 designated Opportunity Zones nationwide

### Tax Benefits of Opportunity Zone Investments

**Three Major Tax Incentives:**

#### 1. **Deferral of Capital Gains**
- Defer paying taxes on prior capital gains until December 31, 2026 (or when QOZ investment is sold, if earlier)
- Must invest capital gains into Qualified Opportunity Fund within 180 days
- Defers the original gain recognition

#### 2. **Step-Up in Basis**
- If held for 5 years: 10% of deferred gain is permanently excluded
- If held for 7 years: Additional 5% excluded (15% total)
- *(Note: Due to timeline, these benefits have largely expired for most investors)*

#### 3. **Permanent Exclusion of New Gains**
- **THE BIG ONE:** If investment held for at least **10 years**, pay **ZERO capital gains tax** on appreciation
- Only applies to new gains from Opportunity Zone investment
- Not the deferred gain, but the new appreciation
- Potentially worth millions in tax savings

**Example:**
- Invest $1M capital gains into OZ project
- Hold for 10+ years
- Project appreciates to $3M
- Sell in 2030+
- Pay zero tax on the $2M gain
- (Still owe tax on original $1M gain in 2026, but that's it)

### Opportunity Zone Investment Requirements

**To Qualify for Tax Benefits:**

1. **Invest Through Qualified Opportunity Fund (QOF)**
   - Special investment vehicle
   - Can be partnership or corporation
   - Must hold at least 90% of assets in Qualified Opportunity Zone Property

2. **Substantial Improvement Requirement**
   - For existing buildings, must invest equal to basis in improvements
   - Essentially means doubling your basis through improvements
   - New construction automatically qualifies
   - Land doesn't count toward test

3. **Active Business Requirement**
   - Property must be used in active trade or business
   - Rental real estate qualifies
   - Can't be passive holding
   - "Sin businesses" excluded (liquor stores, casinos, etc.)

4. **Timeline Requirements**
   - Capital gains must be invested within 180 days
   - Working capital must be deployed within 31 months
   - Property must be held at least 10 years for full tax benefit

### How Creative Finance Fits with Opportunity Zones

**The Powerful Combination:**

Creative finance and Opportunity Zones can work together in multiple ways to maximize returns while minimizing capital requirements and taxes.

#### Strategy 1: **Acquire with Creative Finance, Improve for OZ Benefits**

**Structure:**
1. **Acquire apartment building in OZ using Subject-To**
   - Little to no money down
   - Existing mortgage stays in place
   - Take control of property quickly

2. **Invest Capital Gains into Improvements**
   - Use deferred capital gains (from other investments) for rehab
   - Meet "substantial improvement" requirement
   - Qualify for OZ tax benefits

3. **Hold for 10+ Years**
   - All appreciation tax-free
   - Rental income builds wealth
   - Original mortgage paid down by tenants
   - Existing low-rate financing preserved

**Example Deal:**
- Find 20-unit apartment in OZ, needs work
- Existing mortgage: $800K at 4.5% (2019 loan)
- Property value as-is: $1.2M
- ARV after rehab: $2.5M
- Structure as Subject-To (take over $800K mortgage)
- Invest $800K+ in improvements (capital gains from previous sale)
- Hold 10 years
- Appreciation from $1.2M to $3M+ = $1.8M+ tax-free
- Plus mortgage paid down by rent
- Plus cash flow during holding period

**Benefits:**
- Minimal capital to acquire (Subject-To)
- OZ capital deployed into improvements
- Preserve favorable existing financing
- Maximize tax benefits
- Force appreciation through rehab

#### Strategy 2: **Seller Financing for OZ Ground-Up Development**

**Structure:**
1. **Acquire Land with Seller Financing**
   - OZ land purchased from owner
   - Seller holds note (no bank involved)
   - Minimal down payment
   - Preserves capital for construction

2. **Build Apartments with OZ Fund Capital**
   - Qualified Opportunity Fund invests in new construction
   - Ground-up development automatically qualifies
   - No substantial improvement test needed

3. **Refinance or Hold**
   - After stabilization, can refinance if needed
   - Or hold long-term for tax-free appreciation

**Example Deal:**
- Land in OZ available for $500K
- Seller willing to hold note (20% down, $100K)
- Build 40-unit apartment complex: $6M construction
- Use QOF capital for construction
- Stabilize property at $10M value
- Hold 10 years: Appreciation from $6.5M to $15M+ all tax-free

#### Strategy 3: **Lease Option with OZ Improvement Capital**

**Structure:**
1. **Lease Option on OZ Property**
   - Control property without purchase
   - Master lease existing apartment building
   - Option to purchase at set price

2. **Deploy OZ Capital into Improvements**
   - Make qualifying improvements during lease period
   - Increase value and rents
   - Meet substantial improvement requirement

3. **Exercise Option and Hold**
   - Purchase at predetermined price
   - Already improved with OZ capital
   - Hold for 10 years for tax-free gains

**Benefits:**
- Test property operations before buying
- Use OZ capital to improve and increase value
- Lock in purchase price while improving
- Full OZ tax benefits upon purchase

#### Strategy 4: **Syndication with Mixed Capital**

**Structure:**
1. **Sponsor Uses Creative Finance to Acquire**
   - Find large apartment complex in OZ
   - Structure as creative finance deal (Subto, seller financing, etc.)
   - Minimize capital needed for acquisition

2. **Syndicate OZ Improvement Capital**
   - Raise capital gains money from investors into QOF
   - Deploy for substantial improvements
   - Multiple investors benefit from OZ tax treatment

3. **Split Returns**
   - Sponsor gets promoted interest for finding/managing deal
   - Investors get tax-free appreciation
   - Property cash flows to all parties

**Example:**
- 100-unit apartment in OZ
- Existing seller financing available: $8M at 5%
- Negotiate assumption or Subject-To
- Syndicate $10M QOF for improvements
- Investors get tax-free appreciation
- Sponsor gets deal flow and promoted interest

### Critical Considerations for Combining Strategies

**Legal & Tax Complexity:**
- **Require Specialized Attorneys:** OZ + Creative Finance is complex
- **Tax Advisors Essential:** CPA with OZ expertise
- **Structure Properly:** QOF must be properly formed and maintained
- **Annual Compliance:** OZ funds have reporting requirements
- **State-Specific Rules:** Some states don't conform to federal OZ benefits

**Timeline Management:**
- **180-Day Clock:** Capital gains must be invested quickly
- **31-Month Rule:** Working capital deployment deadline
- **10-Year Hold:** For maximum benefit, must hold decade+
- **Creative Finance Terms:** Align with OZ timelines

**Capital Planning:**
- **Two Pools of Capital:**
  - Creative finance minimizes acquisition capital
  - OZ capital for improvements/construction
- **Reserve Requirements:** Budget for holding costs
- **Exit Strategy:** Plan around 10-year hold or longer

**Deal Structuring Considerations:**

**Due-on-Sale Clause Risk with OZ:**
- If using Subject-To with OZ capital
- Lender calling loan would disrupt OZ investment timeline
- Mitigation: Strong insurance, payment history, potentially land trust
- Have contingency plans

**Ownership Structure:**
- QOF typically owns the property
- If using Subject-To, structure carefully
- Legal counsel essential for proper setup
- Consider series LLC for multiple properties

**Combining Exit Strategies:**
- Creative finance often has balloon payments
- OZ benefits require 10-year hold
- Refinancing OZ property is possible (not a sale)
- Plan refinance around years 5-7 to handle balloons

### Opportunity Zone Markets to Target

**For Maximum Creative Finance + OZ Benefits:**

**Ideal Characteristics:**
- Growing population/job market
- Designated Opportunity Zone
- Distressed properties available
- Motivated sellers (financial stress, out-of-state owners, etc.)
- Strong fundamentals despite OZ designation
- Gentrification/revitalization indicators

**Example Markets (Research Current Designations):**
- Secondary markets with growth
- College towns with designated zones
- Transitional neighborhoods in major cities
- Areas with planned infrastructure improvements
- Proximity to employment centers

**Due Diligence Critical:**
- Verify OZ designation (IRS mapping tool)
- Understand local regulations
- Market research on rental demand
- Exit market projections for 10+ years out
- Political and economic stability

## 7. Common Pitfalls

### For Beginners in Creative Finance

#### Pitfall 1: **Analysis Paralysis (Not Taking Action)**

**The Problem:**
- Endless education without doing deals
- Waiting for "perfect" deal
- Fear disguised as "preparation"
- Overthinking every scenario

**How to Avoid:**
- Set action deadlines (e.g., "I'll make 10 offers this month")
- Understand that learning happens by doing
- Accept that first deal won't be perfect
- Join community for accountability (like SubTo)
- Remember: Expensive education is not doing a deal; mistakes on small deals are cheap education

**Pace's Advice:**
"Your first deal will probably be your worst deal—and that's okay. Do it anyway."

#### Pitfall 2: **Neglecting Due Diligence**

**The Problem:**
- Rushing to close without proper investigation
- Not checking title for liens/judgments
- Failing to verify mortgage details
- Skipping property inspection
- Not confirming seller actually owns property
- Missing code violations or tax liens

**Critical Due Diligence Checklist:**

**Title & Legal:**
- ✅ Run title search (professional title company)
- ✅ Check for liens, judgments, encumbrances
- ✅ Verify property taxes are current (or know what's owed)
- ✅ Confirm seller is on title and has authority to sell
- ✅ Check for code violations with city
- ✅ Review HOA status (if applicable)

**Mortgage Details:**
- ✅ Verify current loan balance (call lender or review statement)
- ✅ Confirm monthly payment amount
- ✅ Get interest rate and loan terms
- ✅ Verify payment history (are they current or behind?)
- ✅ Check for existing defaults or notices
- ✅ Review due-on-sale clause language

**Property Condition:**
- ✅ Professional inspection (or do thorough walk-through)
- ✅ Assess repair needs and costs
- ✅ Check major systems (HVAC, roof, plumbing, electrical)
- ✅ Environmental concerns (mold, asbestos, lead paint)
- ✅ Rental market analysis (if holding as rental)
- ✅ Verify actual rents vs. market rents

**How to Avoid:**
- Build due diligence checklist and use every time
- Work with reputable title company
- Hire inspectors for properties you're not expert in
- Don't skip steps to "move fast"—fast and thorough aren't mutually exclusive
- Budget for due diligence costs ($1,000-2,000+ per deal)

#### Pitfall 3: **Improper Documentation**

**The Problem:**
- Using outdated or incorrect contract templates
- Missing key legal protections
- Not recording documents properly
- Verbal agreements without written backup
- DIY legal work in complex situations
- Mixing up state-specific requirements

**Critical Documents for Subject-To:**
1. Purchase Agreement
2. Warranty Deed or Quitclaim Deed
3. Authorization to Make Payment (AMP)
4. Disclosure acknowledgment from seller
5. Memorandum of Agreement (sometimes)
6. Land Trust documentation (if using)
7. Insurance assignments and documentation

**How to Avoid:**
- Invest in proper legal templates (SubTo provides these)
- Have real estate attorney review documents
- Record documents with county when required
- Use title company for closing when possible
- Keep meticulous records of all agreements
- Get everything in writing

**Legal Review Investment:**
Budget $500-$1,500 for attorney review on first few deals. It's insurance against $50,000+ mistakes.

#### Pitfall 4: **Ignoring the Due-On-Sale Clause**

**The Problem:**
- Pretending it doesn't exist
- Not understanding the risk
- No mitigation strategy
- Panic if lender contacts
- No plan if loan called due

**Reality Check:**
- Due-on-sale clause exists in virtually all mortgages
- Lender CAN legally call loan due when title transfers
- In practice, rarely enforced if payments continue
- Risk increases with: large loans, commercial properties, loans sold to new servicer

**How to Mitigate:**

**1. Make Payments On Time (Critical)**
- Never miss or be late
- Automate payments if possible
- Banks don't look for problems when receiving money

**2. Keep Insurance Current**
- Proper hazard insurance
- List appropriate parties
- Never let lapse

**3. Consider Land Trust**
- Transfer into land trust
- You become beneficiary
- Adds layer of privacy
- Discuss with attorney

**4. Build Reserves**
- Have 6-12 months mortgage payments saved
- Safety net if loan called
- Refinance backup plan

**5. Relationship with Seller**
- Keep seller informed
- They may get statements—don't surprise them
- Maintain trust

**If Lender Calls:**
- Don't panic—you have options
- Refinance (if you qualify)
- Sell property
- Negotiate with lender (may accept assumption)
- Legal counsel immediately

#### Pitfall 5: **Overpaying or Negative Cash Flow**

**The Problem:**
- Emotion overrides numbers
- Falling in love with property
- Ignoring cash flow requirements
- Hoping for future appreciation
- Underestimating expenses

**The Numbers That MUST Work:**

**Cash Flow Formula:**
```
Gross Rent
- Vacancy (5-10%)
- Mortgage Payment
- Property Taxes
- Insurance
- HOA (if applicable)
- Repairs & Maintenance (5-10% of rent)
- CapEx Reserves (5-10% of rent)
- Property Management (8-10% if not self-managing)
= Net Cash Flow (should be positive)
```

**How to Avoid:**
- **Run conservative numbers:** Overestimate expenses, underestimate income
- **Don't speculate on appreciation:** Cash flow from day one
- **Know your market:** Accurate rent comps
- **Build in reserves:** Expect the unexpected
- **Walk away if numbers don't work:** Abundance mindset—next deal is coming

**Red Flags:**
- "I'll raise rents immediately to market" (maybe, maybe not)
- "Property will appreciate quickly" (maybe, but don't bet on it)
- "I'll do repairs myself to save money" (time cost is real)
- "Tenant will pay more once I fix it up" (vacancy risk)

#### Pitfall 6: **Dealing with Unmotivated or Unethical Sellers**

**The Problem:**
- Seller not truly motivated
- Wasting time on deals that won't close
- Seller trying to scam or defraud
- Seller with unrealistic expectations
- Seller who will back out or cause problems

**Motivation Level Test:**
Ask these questions:
- "What happens if you don't sell?"
- "What's your timeline?"
- "Have you listed with a realtor?" (If yes, why considering alternative?)
- "What's your ideal outcome?"
- "What's your bottom line?"

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ Seller shopping your offer to get traditional buyer
- ❌ Seller won't provide mortgage details
- ❌ Seller being evasive about property condition
- ❌ Seller pressuring for quick decision but won't allow due diligence
- ❌ "Too good to be true" scenarios
- ❌ Seller with criminal history of fraud (check public records)

**How to Avoid:**
- Pre-qualify seller's motivation before investing time
- Trust your gut—if something feels off, it probably is
- Don't chase—work with willing, motivated sellers
- Verify everything they tell you
- Walk away from bad actors

#### Pitfall 7: **Inadequate Exit Strategy Planning**

**The Problem:**
- No plan for how deal ends
- Trapped in property you want to exit
- Balloon payment coming due with no plan
- Can't sell because overleveraged
- Market turns and you're stuck

**Every Deal Needs Exit Strategy:**

**Potential Exits for Creative Finance Deals:**
1. **Long-term Hold:** Tenant pays down mortgage, build wealth through appreciation and principal paydown
2. **Refinance:** Improve property, build equity, refinance into traditional mortgage, cash out or pay off seller
3. **Sell Retail:** Market recovers, property improved, sell to retail buyer
4. **Sell to Investor:** Sell as rental property to another investor
5. **Assign/Flip:** Wholesale deal to another investor before closing
6. **Seller Carries Note:** When you sell, offer creative financing to your buyer

**Plan Multiple Exits:**
- Primary exit strategy
- Backup plan (Plan B)
- Emergency exit (Plan C)

**Questions to Answer Before Deal:**
- "How do I plan to exit this deal?"
- "When does balloon payment come due? How will I handle it?"
- "What if I need to exit early?"
- "What if market drops?"
- "What's my break-even point?"

#### Pitfall 8: **Underestimating Property Management**

**The Problem:**
- "I'll just manage it myself"—harder than it sounds
- Time drain from full-time job or other deals
- Tenant issues become your 3am problem
- Lack of systems leads to chaos
- One bad tenant can ruin cash flow

**Reality of Property Management:**
- Tenant screening (applications, credit checks, references)
- Lease agreements and legal compliance
- Collecting rent and handling late payments
- Maintenance requests and emergency repairs
- Evictions when necessary (legal process, costly, time-consuming)
- Inspections and property upkeep
- Accounting and record keeping
- Legal compliance (fair housing laws, local ordinances)

**How to Avoid:**
- **Budget for property management** (8-10% of rent) from beginning
- **Start with property manager** if you have full-time job
- **If self-managing:** Systems from day one (software, processes, boundaries)
- **Screen tenants thoroughly** (credit, background, income verification, references)
- **Have reserves for vacancy and problems**
- **Know landlord-tenant law** in your area

**When to Hire Property Manager:**
- More than 5 properties (too much self-management)
- Out-of-state properties
- Full-time job and side hustle balance
- Wanting to scale quickly
- Value your time over management fees

#### Pitfall 9: **Mixing Creative Finance with Unrelated Complexity**

**The Problem:**
- First deal being complex multi-strategy hybrid
- Combining too many techniques before mastering basics
- Adding partners/investors before you understand structure
- Jumping to commercial before understanding residential
- Trying to do everything at once

**How to Avoid:**
- **Master Subject-To first** (simplest creative strategy)
- **First deal should be straightforward:** Motivated seller, simple structure, positive cash flow
- **Add complexity gradually:** Once you've done 3-5 basic deals
- **Crawl, walk, run approach**
- **Get wins under belt** before advanced strategies

**Progression:**
1. **Deals 1-5:** Subject-To single family or small multi-family
2. **Deals 6-15:** Add seller financing, lease options
3. **Deals 16+:** Hybrid structures, partnerships, larger projects

#### Pitfall 10: **Failure to Build Team**

**The Problem:**
- Trying to do everything yourself
- Not having trusted professionals
- Using wrong professionals (not familiar with creative finance)
- Cheap vs. right professionals
- No system for team coordination

**Essential Team Members:**

**1. Real Estate Attorney**
- Familiar with creative finance
- Can review/draft contracts
- State-specific expertise
- Handles closings (or works with title company)

**2. Title Company**
- Willing to work with creative deals
- Understands Subject-To, seller financing, etc.
- Not all title companies will—find yours early

**3. Insurance Agent**
- Proper coverage for investment properties
- Understands landlord policies
- Comfortable with creative structures

**4. CPA/Tax Advisor**
- Real estate investor focus
- Understands creative finance tax treatment
- Proactive tax planning (not just tax filing)

**5. Property Inspector**
- Thorough and fast
- Reliable estimates
- Red flag identifier

**6. Contractor/Handyman**
- Reliable and reasonably priced
- Responsive for emergencies
- Quality work

**7. Property Manager** (if not self-managing)
- Investor-friendly
- Good track record
- Reasonable fees

**8. Realtor/Wholesaler Network**
- Deal flow source
- Market knowledge
- Buyer list for exits

**How to Build Team:**
- Ask SubTo community for recommendations
- Interview multiple before choosing
- Start relationships before you need them
- Pay for expertise (false economy to cheap out)
- Build long-term relationships
