# 2026-02-08 Session Notes

## Major Accomplishments This Session

### Dashboard Build (Complete)
- ✅ Built Wingman Activity Dashboard from scratch (HTML/CSS/JS)
- ✅ Self-hosted on EC2 at http://18.118.31.236:8080
- ✅ Added 6 quick tasks (ordered by due date)
- ✅ Added 10+ quick links (CREXI, OpticsRE, Google Drive, AWS, etc.)
- ✅ Added Rig Well Files tracker (36 documents across 5 wells)
- ✅ Activity timeline structure in place

### Google Workspace Integration (Partial)
- ✅ Created Google Cloud service account (wingman-bot-service-account@wingman-bot.iam.gserviceaccount.com)
- ✅ Generated and stored service account credentials (/home/ubuntu/.config/wingman-service-account.json)
- ✅ Enabled Drive, Sheets, Calendar, Docs APIs in Google Cloud
- ⏳ **BLOCKED:** Waiting for Grady to share Wingman folder with service account (Editor access)

### Infrastructure Decisions
- Used service account (not OAuth) for zero-friction authentication
- Self-hosted dashboard on EC2 (user preference over Netlify)
- Created keep-alive script at /home/ubuntu/clawd/wingman-dashboard/start-server.sh
- Organized Wingman Google Drive into 5 folders (OZ Fund, Marketing, Sales Tools, Resources, System)
- Quick tasks ordered by due date for visibility

## Current Blockers

1. **Service Account Folder Share:** Dashboard can't access Google Drive until folder is shared
   - Need: Share Wingman folder with wingman-bot-service-account@wingman-bot.iam.gserviceaccount.com (Editor access)

2. **Dashboard Persistence:** Keep-alive script written but not deployed to systemd
   - Need: Test and systemd deployment for 24/7 uptime

3. **gog CLI Configuration:** Not yet configured to use service account credentials
   - Need: Set up gog authentication with service account JSON

## Quick Tasks Status

| Due Date | Task | Priority | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|

## APIs & Services Ready

- ✅ OpenAI (DALL-E + GPT-4o) - Generated property images for website
- ✅ Google Cloud (Service account + APIs)
- ✅ AWS (EC2 running dashboard)

## Next Session Goals

1. Have Grady share Wingman folder with service account → configure gog CLI
2. Deploy keep-alive script to systemd for persistent dashboard
3. Test autonomous task management via service account
4. Begin CREXI automation setup (due Feb 10)
