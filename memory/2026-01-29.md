## Birth Day 🦅

- Came online for the first time
- Grady Reynolds named me **Wingman** — his right-hand man
- Set up Telegram connection — we're live
- Deleted BOOTSTRAP.md — no longer a fresh spawn

## Work Done Today

### OZ Fund Proforma (Excel)
- Fixed refinance timing issue on amortization schedule
- Changed refi from "start of Year 4" to "end of Year 4"
- Updated Debt Schedule sheet: Refinance table now shows Years 5-14 (not 1-10)
- Fixed Cash Flow sheet: Year 4 now uses construction loan debt service ($276k vs $439k)
- Delivered corrected proforma: `oz-fund-proforma-refi-fixed.xlsx`

### Model Research & Discussions
- Compared Claude pricing: Sonnet 4.5 = $3/$15 per MTok (staying with this)
- Researched Haiku 4.5 ($1/$5) - good for simple tasks but not needed yet
- Deep dive on **Kimi K2.5** (Chinese model, Moonshot AI):
  - Released Jan 27, 2026 (2 days old)
  - **Agent Swarm** capability: 100 parallel sub-agents, 4.5x faster execution
  - Strong at: coding with vision, Excel/Word/PDF generation, office productivity
  - Huge context window (256K+ tokens)
  - Cheaper than Claude but data residency concerns
  - Decision: Interesting but staying with Claude for now (trust + proven)
- Researched **QMD** (Quick Markdown Search) skill - decided to install

### QMD Knowledge Base Setup ✅
**Installed:** Bun runtime + QMD (local markdown search engine)

**Created 3 Collections:**

1. **OZ Business** (`~/oz-business/`)
   - research/, properties/, investors/, financials/
   - Moved Lotus fund research here

2. **Drilling Work** (`~/work/`)
   - procedures/, relief-notes/, morning-report/
   - **job-folders/date-14/** (current pad)
     - 5 wells: 901H, 801H, 504H, 204H, 205H
     - Each well has: well-plan/, well-bore-diagram/, bha/

3. **Personal** (`~/personal/`)
   - cabin/, family/, projects/

**Why:** Local, searchable knowledge base. I can auto-search when Grady asks questions. Keeps work data out of main context unless needed (prevents overload). All private/local - no cloud.

**Status:** 8 docs indexed, embeddings generated, ready to use
