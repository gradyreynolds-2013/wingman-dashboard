# 2026-02-01 Daily Log

## Grok 4-1 Model Added ✅
- **Installed:** xAI Grok 4-1 (fast reasoning model)
- **Context Window:** 2M tokens (initially configured as 131K, corrected to 2M)
- **Cost:** $5 input / $15 output per million tokens
- **Alias:** `grok`
- **Usage:** Available for `/model grok` in any session
- **Extended Thinking:** Enabled with `supportsReasoningEffort: true`

**Model Cost Comparison:**
- Haiku: $1/$5 (cheapest)
- Sonnet: $3/$15 (current default)
- Grok: $5/$15 (2M context, reasoning)
- Opus: $15/$75 (most expensive)

**Decision:** Keep Haiku for sub-agents (cost efficiency), Sonnet as default, Grok available for complex reasoning or massive context needs.

## Anthropic Model Configuration Issue
- Initial attempt to add Anthropic models to catalog broke Haiku
- Issue: Clawdbot has native Anthropic support; custom provider definition conflicted
- **Fix:** Removed custom Anthropic provider, enabled `models.mode: "merge"` to include built-in models
- Haiku/Sonnet/Opus now work via native integration

## Software Update Status
- **Current Version:** 2026.1.24-3
- **Attempted:** v2026.1.30 (GitHub release exists but not published to npm yet)
- **Auto-updater:** Running daily at 10:00 AM UTC
- **Skill Updated:** self-improving-agent 1.0.2 → 1.0.4

## Solar Monitoring Script - Weather Fix ✅
**Problem:** Weather requests timing out (wttr.in slow/rate limiting)

**Solutions Applied:**
1. ✅ Added 2-second delays between weather requests (prevents rate limiting)
2. ✅ Increased timeout from 10s → 20s per request

**Result:** All three weather locations now load successfully:
- Huntsville, Utah
- Johnson City, Texas
- Jal, New Mexico

**Script:** `/home/ubuntu/clawd/scripts/solar-check.py`
